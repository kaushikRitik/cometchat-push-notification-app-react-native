# React Native Enhanced Push Notifications (Beta) Sample App


The CometChat React Native [Enhanced Push Notifications (Beta)](https://www.cometchat.com/docs-beta/notifications/push-overview) Sample App is capable of handling push notifications for one-on-one (private), group messaging, and even call notifications. This sample app enables users to send and receive text messages, make and receive calls, and effectively displays push notifications for these interactions.


In our sample app:
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) is used for displaying push notifications in Android  
- Apple Push Notification (APN) is used for displaying push notifications in iOS.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using Push Notifications (Extension), please refer to our [React Native Push Notifications (Extension)](https://github.com/cometchat/cometchat-push-notification-app-react-native/tree/v4-push-notifications-extension) Sample app.

2. Select an existing app or create a new one.
3. Click on the Notifications section from the menu on the left.

## Run the Sample App

4. Add your app credentials like `APP_ID`, `REGION`, and `AUTH_KEY` in the `src/CONSTS.ts` file.
5. Also enter the correct Provider IDs that will be used to register the push tokens.
6. Run the sample app
```
npm run android # To run the Android app
npm run ios # To run the iOS app
```
7. Once the app is running on your device or emulator, login with a user.(The iOS app has to be run on a device. The Android app can run on emulator or device.)
8. Allow the permission to display push notifications.
9. Put the app in the background or terminate it.
10. Send a message or call to the logged in user from another device.
